# Carriage

## First-time Setup

-   If you don't have Xcode, you'll first need that.
-   Download Android Studio and install
    -   also download the cmdline version, following the steps here: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager
        after following all 4 steps, copy the entire cmdline-tools folder into where Android Studio installed your SDK (probably ~/Library/Android/sdk/)
-   Follow the steps here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos
    -   and here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#update-your-path
-   When you run `flutter doctor`, look for the errors it gives and correct them, if any
    -   for instance, cocoapods is often out of date. Run `sudo gem install cocoapods`
