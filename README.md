## About
If you have a disability that prevents you from walking around campus, getting around can be difficult. This is an **Android and iOS** app that helps riders schedule and track rides around campus. 
 
The **Driver App** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-driver). The **Dispatcher and Backend Code** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-web).
